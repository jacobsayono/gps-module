# GPS Module

To use a GPS module in C++, we will need to connect the GPS module to your microcontroller or computer and install a library that provides access to the GPS module's data.

## To use a GPS module in C++:

### 1. Connect the GPS module to your microcontroller or computer.
This typically involves connecting the GPS module's serial or I2C data lines to the corresponding pins on your microcontroller or computer.

### 2. Install a library that provides access to the GPS module's data.
There are several GPS libraries available for C++, such as the TinyGPS++ library and the NeoGPS library.

### 3. Include the GPS library in your C++ program and create an instance of the GPS library's GPS class.
In this case, we write:
```
#include <TinyGPS++.h>
TinyGPSPlus tinyGPS;
```

### 4. Use the GPS class's methods and properties to access the data provided by the GPS module.
This typically involves reading the GPS module's serial or I2C data and parsing it using the GPS library's API.
